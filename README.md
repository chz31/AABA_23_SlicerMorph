## Download sample data
**For this workshop, we are going to use the CT image series of a human head from MorphoSource as the sample data. Download the sample data here: https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000367572?locale=en. You will need to click a MorphoSource account.** Unzip the file. Open the unzipped folder, in the folder "Media 000367572 - Head Ct CTImageSeries CT", you should see another zipped folder "tif-000367572" that contains the TIFF series. Unzip this folder as well.

## Topics will be covered in the workshop
* 3D Slicer and SlicerMorph overview, data loading and saving
* 3D volumetric data loading, visualization, and segmentation
* Landmark annotation
* Generalized Procrustes Analysis and PCA visualization
* Load Slicer and SlicerMorph landmark data into R
* Other modules of SlicerMorph, such as automated landmarking and segmentation
